# ZeroOnePolynomials

The [0-1 Polynomial Conjecture](https://mathoverflow.net/questions/339137/why-do-polynomials-with-coefficients-0-1-like-to-have-only-factors-with-0-1) says:

> **Definition:** Let $R$ be a commutative unital ring. A polynomial $P \in R[x]$ is a ___0-1 polynomial___ if every coefficient of $P$ is either $0_R$ or $1_R$.

> **Conjecture:** Suppose we have two monic polynomials $P, Q \in \mathbb{R}[x]$ with nonnegative coefficients, and let $R(x) \coloneqq P(x) Q(x)$ denote their product. If $R$ is a 0-1 polynomial, then $p$ and $q$ are also 0-1 polynomials.
